# Notes App

This is a simple notes app built using React Native and Async Storage to store notes locally. The app allows users to add, edit, and delete notes, as well as view them in a list format.

## Getting Started

To get started with the app, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies using `npm install`.

## Usage

To launch the app, run `npm start` from the root directory of the project. This will launch the Metro bundler and allow you to run the app on your device or simulator.

## Technologies Used

- React Native
- Async Storage
